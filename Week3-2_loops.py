# Line Continuation

'''
Per Python's Formating guidelines PEP-8;
    https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008
    
-   Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
-   Limiting the required editor window width makes it possible to have several 
    files open side-by-side, and works well when using code review tools that 
    present the two versions in adjacent columns.
    
    Spyder gives you a vertical bar to tell you when to stop ----------------->
    
    A few characters over is OK, but most code should be kept within the 79
    character limit

# There are two ways to "continue" a long line of code
    
# 1) Hit return

#%% FOR loops
#
# For loops are used for iteration (looping through) for a finite number
# of iterations (anything that can be indexed)
#
#   FOR <iterator> in <iterable>:
#       do something for each value in the iterable variable

# The iterator is a temporary variable to store things in the iterable. 
# The name of the iterator should reflect the nature of the list.

# basic FOR loop: loop continues until the end of the list

my_list = [3,6,12,334,-33,300]

for item in my_list:
    print(item)


#%% GENERIC COUNTER with RANGE()
#
# range(start,end,step) creates a temporary list of numbers based on the inputs
# i is a traditional counter variable name (also j,k...)

for i in range(10,100,10):
    i_plus20 = i + 20
    print(i_plus20)

#%% Iterating through lists/strings
#
# In Python, FOR loops iterate through each item in the list and the each time
# the iterator gets assigned the next value from the list (basic FOR example above)

strList = ["Hello,", "how", "are", "you?"]

for word in strList:
    print(word)

phrase = "Fun with FOR loops"

for letter in phrase:
    print(letter)

    
# printing whole words, not just letters

word = ""

for letter in phrase:
    if letter != " ":
        word = word + letter        
    else:
        print(word)
        word = ""


#%% Iterating with indices
#
# Sometimes , we need to iterate through the items, but sometimes we need to
# loop through something and have access to the index value
# - Possibly to do something on a similar sized list
# - Create a new list with specific index values
#
# use the enumerate(list) function

my_list = [3,6,12,334,-33,300]

for index,item in enumerate(my_list):
    print("For Index %i the value is %i" %(index,item))


#%% ENUMERATE con't

my_list = [3,6,12,334,-33,300]
names = ["Mike", "Stuart", "Alice", "Steve", "Megan", "Kevin"]

for index,item in enumerate(my_list):
    print("For Index %i the value is %i and the name is %s" %(index,item,
                                                              names[index]))


#%% Nested FOR loops
#
# Ex. Two lists, calculate value for first value apply that to another list

slope_percent = [6,20,100]
distance = [10,50,100,500,1000]

# Convert slope_percent to gradient and calculate drop over given distances

for slp in slope_percent:
    for dist in distance:
        slp_grad = slp / 100.0
        drop = slp_grad * dist
        print("A slope of %.3f over %i meters is a %.1f meter drop" %(slp_grad,\
                                                                      dist,drop))


#%% WHILE Loop
#
# Use when the iteration length is indeterminate or could change based on
# conditions.
# - Best for waiting for a condition to be met
# - Often used with user input, allows for infinite looping until the user
#   inputs an acceptable value
# - File reading â€“ data files can vary in length
#
# ***WARNING***
#   While loops are prone to being infinite, be careful...

#%% BREAKS
#
# Breaks allow us to get out of a loop (mid-loop if nessesary)
# - A break will only exit out one level in nested loops
#
# In FOR/WHILE loops breaks are usually paired with an IF statement to activate the break

# User input for type of calculation with error checking, only 1 and 2 are
# allowed. Continue in a loop until 1 or 2 is entered.

#%% LIST Comprehensions
#
# Small, automatic FOR loops for lists

# NOTE: I dont usually use these, but for some of you they may come in handy
