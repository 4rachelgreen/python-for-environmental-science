# When I use #%% I'm creating a "code cell" which is a part of a script that you
# can run on its own. When you use the "Run current cell" button (right next
# to the big PLAY button, Spyder basically copies the code and runs it in the
# console. It's useful for me during lecture, you may find it useful if you want
# to isolate a specific segment of your code.
#
# ** IF you have cells and just press the big play (Run) button, spyder will
#    ignore the cells and run the script from top to bottom.

# "NEW FORMATTING"
# different placeholders
# curly brackets with sequential numbers for the different variables
# format codes not explicitly needed, it will default to the type of the variable
